Lecture 10: Advanced Concepts of Discrete-Choice Theory


In this lecture, I will present two advanced concepts. First, nonlinear utilities which are needed to model indifference regimes or, reversely, increased sensitivity near the reference point according to the prospect theory of Kahnemann and Tversky. Secend, I will introduce general extreme value (GEV) models which are the simplest models to include correlated random utilities. This is needed in hierarchical decisions such as simultaneous destination and mode choice or chosing between a car and different variants of public transport, e.g., buses and trams
